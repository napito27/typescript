# typeScript quiz

TypeScript Basics Component: Create a component that displays a list of TypeScript basics, defined in a TypeScript array of strings. Practice typing your component's props and state.
Interface and Props Component: Design a component that accepts props for displaying a user profile, including name, age, and a list of hobbies. Use an interface to type the props.
State with TypeScript in Functional Component: Implement a counter component that uses useState to manage its count state, typed with TypeScript. Include buttons to increment and decrement the count.
Event Handling Component: Develop a component with a button that, when clicked, updates the state. Type the click event handler using TypeScript to ensure proper event typing.
Conditional Rendering and Optional Props: Create a component that optionally accepts a message prop and displays it if present. Use TypeScript to make the prop optional and demonstrate conditional rendering based on its presence.
Context API with TypeScript: Set up a React context for a theme (e.g., dark or light) with a corresponding provider and consumer component, typed with TypeScript. This will help you practice using generics and typing context.
Generic List Component: Implement a generic list component that can display items of any type (strings, numbers, or a custom object). Use TypeScript generics to allow for flexible item types.
Readonly Array Display Component: Create a component that accepts and displays a readonly array of items, showcasing how to define and use readonly types in TypeScript.
Type Alias and Union Types Component: Build a component that demonstrates the use of type aliases and union types, for example, by accepting multiple types of input (string, number, or a predefined object) and displaying it appropriately.
Tuple and Type Assertion Component: Develop a component that uses a tuple for state management, for example, a state that holds both a boolean and a string. Additionally, include an example of using type assertion to handle a scenario where the type of a variable needs to be asserted explicitly.
